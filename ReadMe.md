* Part A - Foundations 8.2
* Part B - Foundations Practice

## Part A

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex01` look at the file `ArrayList1`.

#### Step 02

* Modify the program to implement:
  * Create an ArrayList of Strings called students
  * Add four students to the ArrayList: Amy, Bob,Cindy and David
  * Print the elements in the ArrayList and display its size

#### Step 03

* Modify the program to implement:
  * Add two more students, Nick and Mike, at index 0 and 1
  * Remove the student at index 3
  * Print the elements in the ArrayList and display its size

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partA.ex02` look at the file `ArrayList2`.

#### Step 02

* Perform the following:
  * Create an ArrayList with a list of numbers
  * Display the contents of the ArrayList by using Iterator
  * Remove all even numbers
  * Display the contents of the ArrayList

## Part B

### Exercise 01

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex01` look at the file `ArrayListDemoExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex01` complete the `ArrayList1` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist that contains the following: Steve, Tim, Lucy, Pat, Angela, Tom
        Print this out to the console
        Remove Steve and Angela
        Print out the updated arraylist to the console
        Remove the third element by index
        Print out the updated arraylist to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
[Steve, Tim, Lucy, Pat, Angela, Tom]
[Tim, Lucy, Pat, Tom]
[Tim, Lucy, Tom]
```

### Exercise 02

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex02` look at the file `ArrayListOperationsExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex02` complete the `ArrayList2` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist of Strings
        Using the add method, add four unique values to it
        Sort the list
        Print out the contents using a loop
        Create a second list of numbers
        Using the add method, add four unique values to it
        Sort the list
        Print out the contents using a loop

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Apple
Banana
Grapes
Mango
Sorting numbers...
1
11
21
51
```

### Exercise 03

#### Step 01

In the package `partB.ex03` look at the file `ArrayListTraversingExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `partB.ex03` complete the `Traversing` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist that contains five unique string elements
        Iterate through the arraylist and print out the contents to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Gregor Clegane
Khal Drogo
Cersei Lannister
Sandor Clegane
Tyrion Lannister
```
